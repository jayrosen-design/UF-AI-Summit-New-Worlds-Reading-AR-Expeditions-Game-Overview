The University of Florida College of Education and Lastinger Center for Learning are exploring how Augmented Reality technology can inspire kids to engage with more books while developing solutions for young learners statewide. Designed to boost reading motivation for 3rd to 5th grade students in Florida who are reading below grade level, AR Expeditions is an application that transforms a paper book into an immersive experience. Students explore exciting environments, interact with educational content, and foster a love for reading. AR Expeditions builds confidence and motivates children to build a deeper connection to literacy. The app is slated to launch on iOS and Android in Spring 2025 with the Ocean AR experience, and will be periodically updated to include additional experiences in the future. New Worlds Reading AR will be published by University of Florida on both Google Play and Apple App Store, built for phones and tablet devices.
